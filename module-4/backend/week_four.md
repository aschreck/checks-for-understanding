1. What's your favorite project management tool?
  Pivotal Tracker, if I could learn to use all of its features.
2. Why do we create staging environments?
  We create staging environments to test our code at various levels. First, we build and test something in development to ensure that it works on the most basic level. Then we can test something in development to see how it compiles in a server environment and make sure that all of our assets remain intact and that it plays well with our server configurations.
3. What are the characteristics of a good README (in your opinion)?

   Good READMEs give information on:
    1) what the project is, what it does, and why it exists.
    2) how to set that project up on your local machine (where applicable).
    3) How to contribute to the project.
    4) Links to the docs.
4. What's one main improvement you're going to make to your code regarding accessibility issues?
    Make sure it can be tabbed through.
5. What are some basic security concerns to be aware of when building applications?
    SQL injections, unsecure cookies, session/cookie hijacking, exposed objects.
6. Why is continuous integration helpful/important?
    You know that your code is constantly tested and working in production. This helps you deliver a more agile-style product by keeping updates clean and seamless.
7. What are some pros/cons of using ReactJS as a frontend tool?
